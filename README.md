# My Site

Previously built with React-Static. Now built with Elder.js and Svelte to test SEO functionality and development experience with Elder JS.

Site is static and hosted in S3 (at the moment).

## TODO

### Content

1. Add recent projects

### Deployment

`None for now`

### Dev

1. Poor contrast on some Skill Section items.
   - Not enough to bring Accessibility score for Lighthouse below 90 but worth fixing at some point.
2. Only 98 of 100 for performance LightHouse score.
  - Due to CLS 0.112
  - Honestly not sure what the source is
