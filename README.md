# My Site

Previously built with React-Static. Now built with Elder.js and Svelte to test SEO functionality and development experience with Elder JS.

Site is static and hosted in S3 (at the moment).

## TODO

### Deployment

1. Deploy to live
   1. Auto deploy on main branch `Needs testing`
2. Auto deploy to test
3. Check redirect from www in cloudfront
4. Upload pre-zipped to s3?


### Dev

1. Pod colours use new domain
2. Set numbercolumn highlight to middle of page on initial load
   - This is usefule for mobile
3. Use em for top margin
4. Fix font size for ElderJS in footer
5. Review and potentially fix increasing left margin to account for number column
   - This means making body not centered slightly
   - Probably should only be done on smaller screens
