# My Site

Previously built with React-Static. Now built with Elder.js and Svelte to test SEO functionality and development experience with Elder JS.

Site is static and hosted in S3 (at the moment).

## TODO

1. Terraform gitignore
2. Env vars for both makefile and terraform
3. Auto deploy on main branch
